            <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper to taste</li> 
            <li>1 (14 ounce) package vegetarian ground beef substitute</li> 
            <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar-style soy cheese</li> 
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes in a pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
                Turn the heat to medium-low, and boil potatoes until tender, about 25 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Stir vegan mayonnaise, soy milk, olive oil, vegan cream cheese, and salt into potatoes, and mash 
                with a potato masher until smooth and fluffy. Set mashed potatoes aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and spray a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir onion, carrots, celery, frozen peas, and tomato until 
                softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in Italian seasoning, garlic, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low, and crumble vegetarian ground beef substitute into the skillet with vegetables. Cook and stir, 
                breaking up the meat substitute, until the mixture is hot, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread vegetarian meat substitute mixture into the bottom of the baking dish, and top with prepared mashed potatoes, smoothing 
                them into an even layer. Sprinkle potatoes with shredded soy cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and slightly browned and the casserole is hot, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
